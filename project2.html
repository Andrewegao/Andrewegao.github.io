        <h2>Project 2 Description</h2>
        <p>This project was also one of my first projects that I created for my CS 396: Generative Methods class.
            Similar to the first project, I also used p5.js, which is a JavaScript library for creative coding, to
            create this gif.</p>
        <p>This project is the second part of first project, which is to also utilize the p5.js library to create an
            animated gif. For this project, I chose to create an animated that contains several balloons flying away,
            but there are seamlessly balloons flying into the screen. This creates the illusions that there are
            constantly ballons. It's also important to note that when parts of the ballons flies out of the top of the
            screen,
            the user can see parts appearing at bottom a screen, which creates a seamless loop. </p>
        <p>This is also one of my first project using p5.js library since it's the second assigned project. From this
            particular ballon project, I learned how to create gifs that have a seamless loop, which is very satisfying
            to look at. </p>
