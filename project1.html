        <h2>Project 1 Description</h2>
        <p>This project was one of my first projects that I created for my CS 396: Generative Methods class.
            I used p5.js, which is a JavaScript library for creative coding, to create this gif.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project is to utilize p5.js to generate animated gifs that we can present to the class.
            Therefore, for the first gif of this project, I created a green-eye that's blinking because I wanted to
            create an animated gif that has the resemblance of something real (eyes blinking). </p>
        <p>This was also the first time I used p5.js library to create gifs, so I was largely unfamiliar with how
            this technology works. However, I became more familiar with it over the next few class projects for CS 396.
