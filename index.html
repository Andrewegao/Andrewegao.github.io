        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Gao, and
            I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at Northwestern.
            As a CS major, I am fascinated by how fundamental CS concepts can be
            applied to other industries, particularly the finance industry. How can we use computers
            to make a trading algorithm more sophisticated?</p>
        <p>As such, I've taken a lot of coursework in Computer Science and interned at a local software start-up.
            And now, I'd like to put that experience to good use in my next internship.</p>
        <p>You can find my
